# Prosthetic-Hand
Research on Multi-task Interactive Operation of Prosthetic Hand Based on Electromyographic（EMG） Signal.

Here is a text introduction to the prosthetic hand interaction, as well as photo and video demonstrations.

We designed a real-time operating system for prosthetic hands, including gesture recognition and force level recognition, to enable amputees to conduct more friendly interaction operations.

The figure above shows healthy people using this system to interact.



After the system has been tested on healthy people, it has also been demonstrated in daily operation on amputee.

The amputee performed a series of routine operations, including pouring water, picking up clothes, etc.
